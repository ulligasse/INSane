This is a SANE Frontend (Windows TWAIN Source) based on SaneWinDS, rewritten in C# for scanning in an Citrix Desktop Enviorment.

Sadly i'm not a full time developer by any means so the code might and will certanly be a little rugh around the edges. Besides that there is a lot of missing comments, which i will add in the futur [ i hope :) ]

Anyhow this code might be benefitial for anyone who needs to be able to scan with SANE under Windows. Although i have not really tested this frontend with any other scanner than the fi-7160, colleges of mine already had successful first scans with other scanners ( This is less due to my program than to the very good native support of SANE )
